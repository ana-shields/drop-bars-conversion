# Converting Disc Brakes Bicycles (MTB/Hybrid) to Drop Handlebars
## Why read?
Do you have a MTB/Hybrid? And it's currently on a flat handlebar configuration and on disc brakes? Want to reuse your MTB disc brake calipers? Keep reading!

## Background
Changing from a flat handlebar to a drop handlebar configuration is not as easy as just swapping out some metallic components. There are things to considered such as brake pulls (generally two types - linear and long pull), drivetrain shifting, 

## What do you need to know?
Generally, you should not mix linear pull component with short pull. E.g. Road brifters with V-brakes is a bad idea. One would like experience the road levers being pulled all the way to touch the handlebar while not providing sufficient braking power. 
However, in my experience, certain MTB brake calipers could work by pre-loading the brake arm. 

## What could work?
* TX805 brake calipers with Sensah road brifters (e.g. Reflex - (tested working), Ignite, Phi (tested working))

## How to make MTB disc brakes caliper work with road levers?
- It is now assumed that you have your brifters and brake calipers are installed and cabled.
- Loosen the bolts on the caliper itself (may not need to loosen adapter if this works)
- Align disc brakes: R-pad in (clockwise) all the way to close the gap. Then back off (anti-clockwise) by AT LEAST 1 click. If you have 1 and a little more clicks, that's OK. 
- Squeeze the brake levers and tighten up the two brake caliper bolts. Your brakes should be centered now.
- Very likely your rotors are not 100% true, back-off 1-2 clicks of your R-pad to prevent rotor rub. 
- At this point, your brake levers should feel a little mushy and the levers may be almost touching your drop handlebars. That is expected. Perform next step to resolve this.
- Since the Sensah levers are short-pull (as opposed to flat-bar levers doing linear pull), be sure to pre-load the brake arm. To pre-load the brake arm, loosen the brake arm bolt, move the arm say 10-20% engaged (as it would be when the brake lever is squeezed) and tighten the cable before tightening the brake arm bolt. Check for disc brake rotor rub. No rub? You may pre-load further for less brake lever travel (and maybe power?).

- Warning: This could have poor results if your disc rotor is already bent. True it as much as possible, or just swap it out with a fresh rotor. (I used RT-56 deore rotor for resin pads)

## What failed for me?
- BR-R517 and Sensah road brifters did not work for me. Insufficient power to even stop even when just pushing the bike without riding. No pre-load was done, and you cannot pre-load the arm for road disc brakes due to shofter brake arm travel. 

## Other information
- A flat-bar tiagra BL-4700 levers has two configurations to allow you to switch between linear and short pulls. 

## Terminology
- Brifters: Brake levers and shifters combined (similar to Shimano STI or SRAM
